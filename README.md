1. Researching State-of-the-Art Algorithms
Classical Computer Vision Techniques:

Canny Edge Detection: Detects edges in an image using a multi-stage algorithm.
Hough Transform: Detects lines in images. It can be used to find the lane lines after edge detection.
**Machine Learning Approaches:**
Support Vector Machines (SVM): Can be used for image segmentation and classification tasks.
Random Forests: Useful for classification problems and can be used to identify lane pixels.

**Deep Learning Approaches:**
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Architectures like LeNet, VGG, ResNet can be adapted for lane detection.
Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs): Useful for semantic segmentation, which can classify each pixel of an image to a specific class.
SegNet, U-Net: Specialized architectures for image segmentation.
End-to-End Learning Approaches: Networks like SCNN (Spatial CNN) and LaneNet are specifically designed for lane detection.


**2. Implementing the Detection System**
**Data Collection and Preparation:**
Collect a diverse set of images and videos of road scenes under different conditions (day, night, rain, snow, etc.).
Annotate the lane lines in these images for supervised learning methods.

**Preprocessing:**
*Convert images to grayscale.
*Apply Gaussian Blur to reduce noise.
*Perform image normalization and scaling.

**Algorithm Implementation:**
**Classical Methods:**
Apply Canny Edge Detection.
Use Hough Transform to detect lines.
Deep Learning Methods:
Choose a suitable deep learning framework (TensorFlow, PyTorch).
Design and train the neural network model using annotated data.
Apply data augmentation techniques to improve the robustness of the model.

**3. Testing and Evaluation**
Performance Metrics:

Accuracy: Percentage of correctly detected lane lines.
Precision and Recall: Evaluate the correctness and completeness of the detected lane lines.
Intersection over Union (IoU): Measure the overlap between the detected lane lines and the ground truth.
Testing Under Various Conditions:

Test the system on different road types (highways, city streets, rural roads).
Evaluate performance under varying lighting conditions (day, night).
Assess robustness in adverse weather conditions (rain, fog, snow).
Real-Time Performance:

Ensure the system can process video frames in real-time.
Optimize the algorithm for speed and efficiency (e.g., using model quantization, GPU acceleration).
